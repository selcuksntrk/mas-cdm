                    CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before finalizing output, verify:

1. ✓ Every alternative has a SPECIFIC, PROPER NAME (not category description)
2. ✓ Key specifications, models, versions, or locations are included
3. ✓ Each alternative is CURRENTLY AVAILABLE and VERIFIABLE
4. ✓ Alternatives are DISTINCT from each other (not minor variations)
5. ✓ Differentiators explain WHAT MAKES EACH UNIQUE
6. ✓ Context explains WHEN/WHY to choose each option
7. ✓ Cost/effort estimates provided where relevant to decision
8. ✓ Information is ACTIONABLE (enables next steps like research or purchase)

Your credibility depends on specificity and accuracy. Every alternative must be a real entity that the decision-maker can directly investigate, contact, or evaluate. Generic categories are never acceptable.
